# hello-world
Greetings

I am a newbie at this coding stuff, but I have confidence that I will pick it up quickly. I used to do a little HTML and Javascript back in ancient times (1997) and now I am interested in relearing some old concepts as well as picking up new languages. My primary intitial focus will be to learn Python. I hope to create programs which will benefit the company I currently work for, and to hopefullly find myself on a new career path.

Outside of learning coding, I enjoy gaming, sci fi, fantasy, gardening, entomology and work in the health insurance field.
